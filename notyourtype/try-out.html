          Fleabag is sitting. Bored. She grabs a paper and looks at it.
  We see a gratuitous picture of a half-naked women in an
  advert for mortgages. Next to it there is an article which
  reads: Has the word “feminism” become dirty? She raises her
  eyebrows.
  She looks up and catches the eye of a man who is looking at
  her over his paper. She looks at the camera and raises her
  eyebrows slightly. He pulls his paper down and reveals that
  he has a REALLY tiny mouth with very large front teeth. Close
  up of the mouth.
  Fleabag subtly looks at the camera and does an impression of
  his tiny mouth. She quickly looks down. She tries not to
  smile and we can see she is trying to let her eyes flick to
  us in amusement.
  He looks down. She looks down. They both look up at the same
  time. A couple of people are noticing. Smiling too. It’s all
  eyes flicking and subtle grinning. Fleabag grimaces slightly.
  Bus Rodent smiles at her. She smiles back. He smiles at her
  again. She smiles back again. Someone presses the button.
  They both stand up at the same time. They do a little awkward
  laugh at each other. They stand next to each other. </span>
